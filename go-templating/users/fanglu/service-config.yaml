  # The `goModuleNamePrefix` and the `serviceDirectoryName` leads to the complete module name.
  # 
  # Notes: 
  # The server name in `goModuleNamePrefix` should not have . (dot) in it.
  # If the server name is like a real server name (e.g., github.com),
  #  `go mod tidy` will want to
  # check with the server on Internet and complains that the module/server doesn't exist.
  # 
  # To generate a service for AKS, the `goModuleNamePrefix` has to be `go.goms.io/aks/rp` 
  # For the user environment this file would be automatically generated, by the script
# that creates the user environment (extracting the value from terraform output) however
# for our development and testing it is manually generated as there is no terraform resources
# to extract the output from.
# To generate a service for AKS and our internal development, the `goModuleNamePrefix` has to be `go.goms.io/aks/rp`
goModuleNamePrefix: go.goms.io/aks/rp
  # A directory on your computer where the service will be stored.
  # For AKS, it is directory that holds the aks-rp repo.
  destinationDirPrefix: ~/aks-rp
  # The directory name after destination_dir_prefix. It holds the service.
  serviceDirectoryName: mygreeterv2
  # The service name in the protobuf.
  serviceName: MyGreeter
  # The middleware module name. This is not decided yet. Thus keep this flexible.
  # Once it is in a fixed location, we can remove this variable.
